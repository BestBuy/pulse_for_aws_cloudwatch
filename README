Description
===========
Pulse for AWS Cloudwatch will pull metrics from AWS Cloudwatch into Splunk and provides sample dashboards for EC2, ELB, RDS, EBS.  It will also pull in the Alarm History for your account and put it in a timeline for you to browse.  The provided scripts and dashboards should work across multiple regions.  However, it has only been tested in us-east-1.
